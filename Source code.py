'Insufficient_Weight':'''
1Strength training: squats, deadlifts, bench presses, shoulder presses, rows, and pull-ups. Start with lighter weights and gradually increase the resistance as you progress.
2. Resistance training: Bicep curls, tricep extensions, lateral raises, and calf raises are some examples. Aim for higher reps (8-12) and moderate weight to promote muscle hypertrophy.
3.Progressive overload: Gradually increase the intensity, weight, or resistance of your exercises over time to continue challenging your muscles and promoting growth. 
4.Caloric surplus: To gain weight, ensure you consume more calories than you burn. Focus on consuming nutrient-dense foods that are high in protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats. 
5.Rest and recovery: Allow your body enough time to rest and recover between exercise sessions. This is when your muscles repair and grow stronger. Aim for at least 1-2 rest days per week, and prioritize quality sleep to support the recovery process.
6.Consistency: Consistency is key when it comes to gaining weight and building muscle. Stick to a regular exercise routine and ensure you're consistently consuming a calorie surplus.''',
