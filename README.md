# Diet and Exercise Recommendation system based on o esity classification.

Here in this project , we will be recommending personalized diet and exercise recommendation for everyone with the help of few inputs about there daily patterns , eating habits and some other metrics. 

Decision tree classifier is used to classify each person into a specific class , in total there are 7 classes from under weight to obese 3.

A simple interactive webpage using streamlit is built and connected to the algorithm. Each user enters the values in the web page using a dropdown or a text box.Then the data entered by the user is given as input to the machine learning model which in return classifies the user inott one of the 7 classes of obesity. 
Based o the class of obesity an appropriate diet and exercise plan is given to the user on week level.

Pne of the most interesting things about this project is, one can select which type of cuisine they want to try.
